> React Native component that notifies if the user is active or not (i.e. when the app surface hasn't been touched for more than a certain amount of ms).

As of version 1.1.0, `react-native-user-inactivity` resets the timer also when the keyboard appears or disappears.
If you want to avoid this behaviour, you can set the `skipKeyboard` property to `true`.

As of version 1.0.0, `react-native-user-inactivity` has been rebuilt as a functional component that uses the new React Hook API.
Thanks to [`usetimeout-react-hook`](https://github.com/jkomyno/usetimeout-react-hook), `react-native-user-inactivity` supports timers different
than the standard one (`setTimeout`). This has solved some of the most recurrent issues, such as #12, #16, #17.

## Install

```sh
npm install react-native-user-inactivity
```

## üîë Key features

* ü•á supports generic timers (you're no longer constrained to `setTimeout`)
* ‚ö†Ô∏è optional reset capability of the timer 
* ‚ú® super elastic behaviour thanks to the Hooks API
* üí™ written in TypeScript
* ‚úîÔ∏è the core logic of this component is delegated to [`usetimeout-react-hook`](https://github.com/jkomyno/usetimeout-react-hook), which has 100% code coverage

## ‚ùî How to use

This package primarily exposes a single functional component, [UserInactivity](src/index.tsx).
The signature of the `UserInactivity` React props is the following:

```typescript
interface UserInactivityProps<T = unknown> {
  /**
   * Number of milliseconds after which the view is considered inactive.
   * If it changed, the timer restarts and the view is considered active until
   * the new timer expires.
   * It defaults to 1000.
   */
  timeForInactivity?: number;

  /**
   * If it's explicitly set to `true` after the component has already been initialized,
   * the timer restarts and the view is considered active until the new timer expires.
   * It defaults to true.
   */
  isActive?: boolean;

  /**
   * Prevents the PanResponder instance from being created so that user
   * gestures are ignored and do not reset the timer.
   * It defaults to false.
   */
  ignoreGestures?: boolean;

  /**
   * Generic usetimeout-react-hook's TimeoutHandler implementation.
   * It defaults to the standard setTimeout/clearTimeout implementation.
   * See https://github.com/jkomyno/usetimeout-react-hook/#-how-to-use.
   */
  timeoutHandler?: TimeoutHandler<T>;

  /**
   * Children components to embed inside UserInactivity's View.
   * If any children component is pressed, `onAction` is called after
   * `timeForInactivity` milliseconds.
   */
  children: React.ReactNode;

  /**
   * If set to true, the timer is not reset when the keyboard appears
   * or disappears.
   */
  skipKeyboard?: boolean;

  /**
   * Optional custom style for UserInactivity's View.
   * It defaults to { flex: 1 }.
   */
  style?: StyleProp<ViewStyle>;

  /**
   * Callback triggered anytime UserInactivity's View isn't touched for more than
   * `timeForInactivity` seconds.
   * It's `active` argument is true if and only if the View wasn't touched for more
   * than `timeForInactivity` milliseconds.
   */
  onAction: (active: boolean) => void;
}
```

When a native timer is needed (in order to avoid issues such as #12, #16, #17) an implementation of
[usetimeout-react-hook's TimeoutHandler](https://github.com/jkomyno/usetimeout-react-hook/#-how-to-use) should be
passed to the `timeoutHandler` prop.
A default one (BackgroundTimer) is optionally provided: in order to use it you must:

* manually run: `npm i -S react-native-background-timer`
* manually link the native library: `react-native link react-native-background-timer`

In case of doubts, please refer to the official [`react-native-background-timer`](https://github.com/ocetnik/react-native-background-timer) repository.

The default `BackgroundTimer` can be used like this:

```tsx
import UserInactivity from 'react-native-user-inactivity';
import BackgroundTimer from 'react-native-user-inactivity/lib/BackgroundTimer';

export default () => {
  return (
    <UserInactivity
      timeForInactivity={2000}
      timeoutHandler={BackgroundTimer}
      onAction={isActive => { console.log(isActive); }}
      style={{ flex: 1, paddingTop: '10%' }}
    >
  );
}
```

## ‚ú® Typings

Since the component itself is written in TypeScript, your editor's intellisense system should automagically detect
the typings file (even if you're using plain JS!), thus providing a better developer experience.
In fact, autocomplete capabilities and warning should come for free as you're typing the props to pass to the `UserInactivity` component.

## üí™ Practical Example

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button } from 'react-native';
import UserInactivity from 'react-native-user-inactivity';

export default () => {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(true);
  const [timer, setTimer] = useState(2000);

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <UserInactivity
        isActive={active}
        timeForInactivity={timer}
        onAction={isActive => { setActive(isActive); }}
        style={{ flex: 1, paddingTop: '10%' }}
      >
        <Button id="btn-1" title="1 Press this to simulate activity" />
        <Button id="btn-2" title="2 Press this to simulate activity" />
        <Text id="text-1" style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>Type below to simulate activity</Text>
        <TextInput
          id="text-input-1"
          style={{height: 40, borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1}}
          onChange={() => { setActive(true); }}
          textContentType="creditCardNumber"
          value={timer.toString(10)}
          onChangeText={text => setTimer(Number.parseInt(text || 0, 10))}
        />
      </UserInactivity>
      <View style={{ flex: 3, backgroundColor: '#fcfcaa', }}>
        <Text style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>{active ? 'ACTIVE' : 'NOT ACTIVE'}</Text>
        <Button title="Manually set to Active" onPress={() => { setActive(true); }} />
      </View>
    </View>
  );
}
```

## üöÄ Build package

This package is built using **TypeScript**, so the source needs to be converted in JavaScript before being usable by the users.
This can be achieved using TypeScript directly:

```sh
npm run build
```
